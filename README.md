# YouTube Shorts Remover
A Chrome extension I use to remove YouTube shorts from the subscriptions page.

## Installation

### Using as a Chrome Extension
1. Manage Extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Load Unpacked
4. Select the extension folder
5. (Optional) Disable Developer Mode

### Using as a Firefox Extension
1. Package the contents of the extension folder as a zip file (the files only, not the folder itself)
2. Manage Extensions
3. Install Add-on From File
4. Select the zip file

### Using with Tampermonkey
Create a new script in Tampermonkey and copy the contents of `extension/youtube-shorts-remover.js` into it.

## Support
I don't plan on providing support if it isn't working for you, though I'll keep it up to date since I use it.
